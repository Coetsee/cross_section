# Introduction \label{Introduction}

This report attempts to apply and compare panel-data methods to investigate the effect of the Covid-19 Social Relief of Distress (SRD) grant on household reported hunger. The SRD is a Covid-specific grant implemented to support unemployed individuals who did not receive any other social grant, UIF (Unemployment Insurance Fund) payment or employment income. The transfer constituted out of 6 monthly payments of R350. Panel-data analysis could prove useful in disentangling this effect due to the possibility of controlling for time invariant unobservables. In the case of panel regression, one could compare household hunger when individuals receive the SRD grant to when they do not, thereby isolating the effects of the SRD more clearly. 

Methodologically, three static panel model specifications are compared: 1) a pooled OLS (POLS), 2) Fixed Effects (FE) Regression and 3) Random Effects (RE) Regression. Throughout, the varying estimators and specifications will be discussed in terms of their ability to obtain causal effects.^[This study attempts to build on similar exploratory analyses such as in @bridgman2020hunger and @kohler2021distribution.]

*You are required to go beyond simply estimating and presenting your results, but to convince the reader of their robustness by presenting alternative specifications. You should apply different estimators and specifications where possible.
Discuss the shortcomings of the estimators in obtaining a causal effect and argue why your strategy is the best available to obtain a causal effect that satisfies relevant assumptions.*


# Data \label{Data}

The analysis in this report relies on the National Income Dynamics Study - Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey 2020 (NIDS-CRAM) data, supplied by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit (SALDRU) from May 2020 to May 2021. NIDS-CRAM is a nationally representative longitudinal household survey, conducted using Computer-Assisted Telephonic Interviews (CATI), meant to investigate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent national lockdown on the South African socio-economic environment [@nids2020].^[Data is publicly available at https://www.datafirst.uct.ac.za/.]

Sample Design

Interviewed individuals were drawn from the sample members of the fifth wave of the NIDS and sampling followed a stratified sampling design. In wave 1, 7073 respondents were interviewed successfully, whilst a top-up of 1084 respondents were added to the sample in wave three. Sampling weights were

## Descriptive Statistics

Figure \ref{hunger} below outlines the proportion of the South African population that have struggled with food insecurity and hunger over the five waves of NIDS-CRAM. There seems to be downward trends in the proportion of individuals that report hunger in at least one person in their household, as well as in child hunger. Although lowering over time, respondents report there to be no money for food in nearly 30% of households.

# Methodology \label{Meth}


OLS

POLS

Want to estimate the effect of treatment, ùê∑ùê∑ùëñùëñ, on outcome ùëåùëåùëñùëñ
> but we don‚Äôt ever observe the same unit in both states
> usuallywe observe some people as treated and others untreated
> OLS will deliver bias estimates if exogeneity doesn‚Äôt hold.
identifying assumption:treated would have looked like untreated if they weren‚Äôt treated

FE (why FE and not RE) - Hausman Test


identifying assumptions - treated would have looked like their previous self if you weren‚Äôt treated

*Type of unconfoundedness (The only violation of unconfoundedness is due to a time invariant unobservable, ùõº_ùëñ, that enter both potential outcomes in the same, linear additive manner. Although selection into treatment is allowed to be correlated with ùõº_ùëñ , it is not allowed to be correlated with ùúÄ_it.

*Same Trends - The time trend does not depend on treatment status. The expected ùúÜùúÜùë° is assumed to be same for everyone.
